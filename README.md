roadmap tasker

This is a basic CLI task manager. The instructions on the roadmap website were to save the file in json but I found CSV easier to work with for this particular problem.
Constructive criticism would be greatly appreciated.

Instructions are as follows:
1. run the program using python3
2. follow the instructions described at the start of the program
3. files are loaded at the start of the program and saved at the end
